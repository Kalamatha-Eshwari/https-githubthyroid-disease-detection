# Thyroid Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to predict thyroid disease recurrence using machine learning techniques. It leverages patient data including age, gender, and medical history to develop models that forecast disease outcomes.

## Scope

### Data Handling
- **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing data.
- **Encoding**: Converted categorical data into numerical format for modeling.
- **Exploration**: Visualized data distributions to understand patterns.

### Modeling
- **Techniques**: Used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for prediction.
- **Training**: Split data into training and test sets, evaluated model performance.
- **Metrics**: Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model effectiveness.

### Implementation
- **Tools**: Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
- **Results**: Achieved high accuracy in predicting thyroid disease recurrence.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Preparation**: Importance of data cleaning and encoding for machine learning tasks.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Understanding different algorithms and their performance metrics.
- **Project Management**: Structured workflow from data exploration to model deployment.
